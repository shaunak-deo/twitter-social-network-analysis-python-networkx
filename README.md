# twitter-social-network-analysis-python-networkx
This repository contains code for Twitter Social Network Analysis using Python and NetworkX. The program retrieves friends and followers, identifies reciprocal friends, creates a social network graph, and calculates the diameter and average distance of the resulting network.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
You need to have Python 3.x installed on your system along with the following packages:
  python-twitter
  networkx
  matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install python-twitter networkx matplotlib

Usage:
Replace the authentication keys for the Twitter API in the code (CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, OAUTH_TOKEN, and OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET) with your own keys. You can obtain these keys by creating a Twitter developer account and creating a new app.
Set the screen_name variable to the Twitter username for which you want to analyze the social network.

Run the code using the following command:
python twitter_social_network.py

The program will output the network size (in terms of numbers of nodes & edges), average distance, and diameter of the social network. It will also save an image file of the social network graph (graph.png) and the program output to a file (output.txt).
